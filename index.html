            <h2 class="Sigmar1">Why does this game even exist<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="Changa">Here at Sphinx Studios, we have a motto that we love to follow. "Ego postulo ut balneo". This roughly transalates to, "I need to use the bathroom" in Latin. we have also created a famous game called Islasball, which can be played on mobile, Pc, and one of our members was brave enought to play islasball on his Smart TV. Here is a link to play islasball: https://funnysathvik.github.io/islasball-v3/. Due to the success of this game, we have decided to make another one to kee pt he public happy and to allow people to play a knockoff version of brawl-stars.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2 class="Sigmar1">When can I expect to be able to play this masterpiece<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="Changa">This amazing game will be released sometime this year. As we have barely been able to do anything to the game so far, the game will most likely be released between the months Aug.-Oct. This is still a very hard deadline to finish the game by and will still be extremely hard to finish as we are using technology that we have never used before to make our games more exciting than ever before. We thank you all for the support during these skibidi times.</p>
